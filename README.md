# Biorhythms

Welcome to Biorhythms. This gem allows you to track your biorythms on a daily basis by saving entries you create about your physical, emotional, and intellectual states.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'biorhythms'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install biorhythms

## Usage

Execute the 'biorhythms' file, found in the 'bin' diretory, to get started. When you start a local server, you will be directed to the index page, which will ask you to either login or create an account.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
